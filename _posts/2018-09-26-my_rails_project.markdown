My third project for this curriculum required me to use Ruby on Rails, a very popular web application framework. At first I was hesitant to build something with Rails. I had just gotten comfortable with Sinatra and wanted to create more with it. However, I realized that Rails allows developers to save a lot of time. For that reason it is no surprise that Rails is the standard web app framework for Ruby. It allows you to get a project up and running quickly. Time is money after all.

To be honest, one thing I don't like about Rails is that it does so much for you. For my Sinatra project I created every single file and directory myself. This allowed me to have an intimate knowledge of all the parts behind my site. Rails comes with alot of bloat that you may not end up using. It doesn't do any harm, but it was a little uncomfortable to not know what to do with those things. However, it was tons of fun to have Rails write some code for me using generators. They took care of the boring stuff in my models, controllers and migrations, which allowed me to focus on the important parts. Clearly, Sinatra and Rails are two great tools. It's up to the developers needs and personal preference to decide what is best for their project. I never want to be afraid of learning a new technology. 

I created a project manager called clipboard. You can find the repo [here.](https://github.com/nkdmiller/rails-clipboard) and check it out!
