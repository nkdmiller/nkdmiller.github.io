This project marks the first time where I pulled an all-nighter just coding. I was so in the zone that I could not sleep and before I knew it the sun was rising. Part of the reason I was so productive in the night was the lack of disruptions. I think a lot of people can relate to that, but it's best not to make a habit of sleep deprivation. 

This project is a continuation of my Rails project Clipboard. It is essentially a project management application that allows users to create and organize projects. Other users can join in on the project by picking up a task. This time around I made heavy use of Javascript and AJAX. The asynchronous approach that AJAX affords to coders allows for smoother applications. I did not have to load a new page anytime I wanted to get new information. This provides incredible convience to users. Frankly, in 2018 all websites should allow for asynchronous activities like AJAX. Otherwise, the website may come off as outdated and sluggish. There are still times to load new pages though. I was impressed by Rails ability to handle JSON so easily. It required learning some new syntax but in the end I did not have to change much of my Rails backend. It was mostly JS errors like forgetting a bracket or using the wrong JQuery selectors that slowed me down. However, I learned tons from those mistakes. It made fixing bugs easier and easier because I recognized common pitfalls and the meanings of errors.
