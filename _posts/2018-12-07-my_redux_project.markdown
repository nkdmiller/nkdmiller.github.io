After spending hours figuring out the complexities of redux, I can say I am done with my final project. I decided to rewrite my CLI project, Stock Report,  into a fully functioning React App. The application allows users to browse stocks on the exchange and add them to a portfolio. Stock and User information are persisted in a Rails database. The react app communicates with the API when it needs information. Additionally, it communicates with an API dedicated to giving real time information on stocks. 

This project was a lot of work and there is still more work I want to do. I have the foundation down with a nice flow of redux state. I learned more in this project than with any others. It was alot of fun using my knowledge of rails and my newly acquired understanding of redux. Despite, the immense challenge of putting all the pieces together it was great!
