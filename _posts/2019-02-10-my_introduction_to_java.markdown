In my Western Michigan job search I have come across multiple positions that require or prefer Java experience. After speaking to a Grand Rapids recruiter who said that Java is ubiquitous in the area I decided to try and pick it up.

Java was created by a group of porgrammers in 1991 and has become one of the most used programming languages in the world. It is similiar to C/C++ in syntax and is object-oriented. There have been 12 releases of Java since the original version. Currently, there is some controversy in the Software Industry since Oracle (current owner of Java) announced it would charge businesses for commercial use. 

Unlike Ruby or Javascript, Java is a compiled language. This means that in order to run the progam it requires a compilation step. Compilation is basically a way to transform a language, like Java, into machine code that your computer can read, and if all goes well execute properly.

If Java has been set up properly and you are in the directory of the file you want to compile enter "javac filename.java". This will create a .class file of the program. Then you can run the file with "java filename". Go [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to install the latest Java version.

This Github [repository](https://github.com/nkdmiller/reverse-string) contains a simple Java program to reverse a string. Once extracted follow these steps (1) Go to the directory where it was extracted. (2) Enter "javac ReverseString.java" (3) Enter "java ReverseString". You should be able to enter a string for reversal.
